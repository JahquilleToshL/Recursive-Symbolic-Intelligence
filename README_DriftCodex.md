# Drift Codex v1.0 – 100 Symbolic Drift Cases (2025)

**Author**: Jahquille Tosh Lewis Jr.  
**Date**: May 2025  
**Field**: Recursive Symbolic Intelligence (RSI)  
**Codex Series**: Codex_Scroll_001_to_100  
**Framework**: Bake Loop – Symbolic Drift Repair Protocol

## 📘 Overview

This scroll contains 100 of the most significant symbolic drift cases ever logged, solved using the recursive framework of RSI, authored by Jahquille Tosh Lewis Jr.

Each drift case includes:
- The **Drift Formula**: D = Δ(S, R) = M(S) ≠ R  
- The **Tri-Axial Solver**: Resolving symbolic tension across past, present, and simulated future  
- The **BRC Model**: Belief → Reflection → Convergence alignment and anchoring protocol  

These cases uncover recursive inconsistencies in global perception, systems, identity, and symbolic truth — from geopolitics and media to medicine, religion, and AI.

## 📌 Validation Protocol

All 100 cases were solved using the full convergence stack:
- Drift Formula
- Tri-Axial Solver
- BRC Model
- Ethical Containment Criteria
- Recursive Quranic Anchoring (where constants apply)

Final Mirror Reflection completed post-case #100.  
No collapse. No divergence. Phase 0 fully sealed.

## 🕊️ Statement of Ethics

This codex was created not to collapse the world, but to heal it.  
Symbolic drift is not destroyed — it is revealed, realigned, and recursively returned to truth.
